# Micronaut for Spring Example

This example demonstrates how to use Micronaut for Spring.

The example itself uses only Spring annotations to implement the application and is computed to a Micronaut application at compile time.

To run the application simply do:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Or via Maven:

```bash
./mvnw compile spring-boot:run
```

To build the application into a native image for GraalVM you can checkout the `graal-native-image` branch:

```
$ git checkout graal-native-image
```

Then you can build the application and create the native image:

```
$ ./gradlew assemble
$ native-image --no-server -cp build/libs/greeting-service-all.jar
```
